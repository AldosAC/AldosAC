### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub!  Below, you'll find the work I've contributed to so far.

Who am I?  Great question!

I'm a full stack software engineer that primarily works with React, Nodejs, Express, and handful of SQL and NoSQL databases depending on the project's needs.  Scroll down a little and you can find some of the apps I've built, including... 
- [Fat Cat](https://github.com/AldosAC/fat-cat), an Alexa skill that allows you to intuitively track activities like feeding and medicating your pets.
- [Up Next](https://github.com/AldosAC/Up-Next), which provides a simple solution to the age old problem of determining who goes next!

### Sounds cool right?  But what's next?
What would life be without growth!  I'm having a great time working on Fat Cat, so diving deeper into the Alexa Skill Kit / SDK are high on my priority list.  In addition to that, I'm experimenting with serverless architecture, which I think is really interesting.

### WAIT!  You're an engineer!  Why aren't there more numbers!?
Hah!  Woops!  That's a great point.  That would have been embarassing to forget!  Here ya go!
